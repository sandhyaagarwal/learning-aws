Some Terminology :

<b>Regions</b> : A certain geographic area where Amazon EC2 is hosted

<b>Availability Zones</b> : Each region has multiple isolated locations, known as Availability Zones. 

An Availability Zone comprises of one or more <b>Data Centers</b>. A Data Center typically has 50000 to 80000 physical servers.

All the availability zones in a region are connected through low latency links, while the regions themselves are isolated from each other.

All communication between the regions is through the public Internet.
